/*BUGS*/
Something is setting width and height on the character image. In turn that cause problems when it's not reset back on image change.
load character is breaking for timeout
Sometimes version numbers in keyword editor gets wonky
character image can overflow ruby and saphire cards - needs css changes
Internet Explorer keeps form data persistent across single page reloads, but not double page reloads...
Adelon Font is broken in IE 11 probably because I'm loading it as woff2 format
Print in general is totally broken in chrome - font is breaking and chrome doesn't render text shadow.
